          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>Getting the img shows up was quite a challenge. As you can see from line 32  $("#output").append(`<img src="${data.img}" alt="${data.alt}">`); We didn't know what was going on why the img couldn't show up til we realized "[" was placed instead of "{". Thanks for Jeremy found out the problem. Also, we three did meet at my dorm to do this lab together due to its difficulty.</p>
